# Image-and-deep-learning-based-product-defects-detection-system
This project will develop a demo to demonstrate image-based defects detection for an industrial production line.  It will need two students to work together to be responsible for hardware and software design, respectively. A student needs to develop a mini- conveyor belt for the hardware design to carry a product(tray) cyclically. Another student will use a webcam fixed above the belt and connected to a laptop to capture images of the passing tray. Then the images will be processed by the deep-leaning based algorithm to detect the surface defects of the tray.
